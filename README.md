This is a shader for SpeedTree version 8.x for Unity.<br>
The shader has advanced settings compared to the standard Unity shader for SpeedTree. The shader fully functions in Forward Rendering and Deferred Rendering (including Subsurface Emission).<br>
Using this shader, you can adjust the wind (speed, amplitude, swaying branches, etc.). The wind settings in the shader, allow you to fix incorrectly configured wind settings in SpeedTree, as well as synchronize and adjust the wind for all vegetation separately.

### Prerequisites

To work on the project, you will need a Unity version of at least 2019.1.8 (64-bit).

### Information

<strong>Attention!</strong> The speed of shader compilation when importing into a project depends on the power of your CPU in your PC. Initial compilation can take a lot of time, so wait for compilation, the shader is large and complex.
On the processor level i3-8100, i5-6600, AMD Ryzen 5 1400, compilation time will take more than 2 minutes.
There is an example in this asset to understand the operation and settings.

<strong>I recommend</strong> importing this asset into a new project. Study the operation of the asset and copy the components you need to your project.

The trees (Broadleaf, Palm) used in the examples are taken from the - [Free SpeedTrees Package](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/speedtree/free-speedtrees-package-29170)

<strong>Features:</strong><br>
- Full wind setting.<br>
- Advanced settings for visualization of vegetation.<br>
- Support for all functions in Forward Rendering and Deferred Rendering.<br>
- Good performance.
